## What is the RegisterHandlerFW
The RegisterHandlerFrameWork (short RegisterHandlerFW or RHFW) is a framework, dedicated to DI (dependency injection), MVP (Model View Presenter principal) and something i like to call the "Register-Pattern", the idea, that instances are bound to Registers and not to procedures.
However, it is not meant to be used for implicated DI! This framework can not resolve direct dependencies! It is more like a tool for MVP.
